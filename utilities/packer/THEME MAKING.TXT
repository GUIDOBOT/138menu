Creating a theme for 138Menu is quite easy, just replace all the image files in this folder and (optionally) 
replace the font file (FONT.PGF) and pack it by launching PACK_win.exe
If you are modding the menu and you need more files just add them on CONFIG.CFG (always leaving an empty line
at the end)

	- Since L3
	Now every theme can have its own font. If you don't include the FONT.PGF file in the package 
	(by removing it from CONFIG.CFG), then the menu will load the default one inside DATA.138.


The .138 package format is the following:
	
	unsigned file_count; 
	//Repeat file_count times:
	{
		unsigned file_size;
		char name[20];
		/** data (file_size bytes) **/
	}
